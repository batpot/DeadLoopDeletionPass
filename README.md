## LLVM Dead Loop Deletion Pass

This pass identifies and eliminates dead loops, which contribute no meaningful computation or side effects. These include:
  1. loops that never execute (e.g., where the loop counter is initialized to 0)
  2. loops that contain no impactful instructions (e.g., lacking function calls or arithmetic operations)
  3. loops consisting only of trivial operations (e.g., adding 0, multiplying by 1, or dividing by 1)
